However, this is not an easy task, at times not even for us humans, but based on a relatively structured set of possible actions, appropriate cues, and the right model, this problem can be computationally tackled. In this paper, we propose to use an ensemble of long-short term memory (LSTM) networks for human action prediction. To train and evaluate models, we used the MoGazedataset - currently the most comprehensive dataset capturing poses of human joints and the human gaze. We have thoroughly analyzed the MoGaze dataset and selected a reduced set of cues for this task. Our model can predict i) which of the labeled objects the human is going to grasp, and ii) which of the macro locations the human is going to visit (such as table or shelf). We have exhaustively evaluated the proposed method and compared it to individual cue baselines. The results suggest that our LSTM model slightly outperforms the gaze baseline in single object picking accuracy, but achieves better accuracy in macro object prediction. Furthermore, we have also analyzed the prediction accuracy when the gaze is not used, and in this case, the LSTM model considerably outperformed the best single cue baseline.","tags":[],"title":"Ensemble of LSTMs and feature selection for human action prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomislav Petković","Jakub Hvezda","Tomáš Rybecký","Ivan Marković","Miroslav Kulich","Libor Preučil","Ivan Petrović"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1557871925,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557871925,"objectID":"c04c2e71a988c79a7f8bf6647699e282","permalink":"https://petkovich.github.io/publication/icra19/","publishdate":"2019-05-15T00:12:05+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/icra19/","section":"publication","summary":"— With the substantial growth of logistics businesses the need for larger warehouses and their automation arises, thus using robots as assistants to human workers is becoming a priority. Worker safety and system efficiency are paramount in such flexible warehouse systems. Dealing with uncertainties in human motion is one of the challenges that an automated warehouse system must tackle. Given that, it is crucial to ensure that human motion is estimated and predicted precisely and in real time. We define the human motion prediction problem in automated warehouses and propose a simulation framework and method to solve it.","tags":[],"title":"Human Motion Prediction Framework for Safe Flexible Robotized Warehouses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomislav Petković","David Puljiz","Ivan Marković","Björn Hein"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1547503925,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547503925,"objectID":"7cf29effea90f84a0b7738b33a1004b4","permalink":"https://petkovich.github.io/publication/rcim19/","publishdate":"2019-01-15T00:12:05+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/rcim19/","section":"publication","summary":"With the substantial growth of logistics businesses the need for larger warehouses and their automation arises, thus using robots as assistants to human workers is becoming a priority. In order to operate efficiently and safely, robot assistants or the supervising system should recognize human intentions in real-time. Theory of Mind (ToM) is an intuitive human conception of other humans’ mental state, i.e., beliefs and desires, and how they cause behavior. In this paper we propose a ToM based human intention estimation algorithm for flexible robotized warehouses. We observe human’s, i.e., worker’s motion and validate it with respect to the goal locations using generalized Voronoi diagram based path planning. These observations are then processed by the proposed hidden Markov model framework which estimates worker intentions in an online manner, capable of handling changing environments. To test the proposed intention estimation we ran experiments in a real-world laboratory warehouse with a worker wearing Microsoft Hololens augmented reality glasses. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the scalability of the approach to larger warehouses, we propose to use virtual reality digital warehouse twins in order to realistically simulate worker behavior. We conducted intention estimation experiments in the larger warehouse digital twin with up to 24 running robots. We demonstrate that the proposed framework estimates warehouse worker intentions precisely and in the end we discuss the experimental results.","tags":[],"title":"Human intention estimation based on hidden Markov model motion validation for safe flexible robotized warehouses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marija Seder","Luka Petrović","Juraj Peršić","Goran Popović","Tomislav Petković","Ana Šelek","Borna Bićanić","Igor Cvišić","Damir Josić","Ivan Marković","Ivan Petrović","Ali Muhammad"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1547503925,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547503925,"objectID":"67cc863cf1ff6b7f6c651130d118d9ed","permalink":"https://petkovich.github.io/publication/ifac/","publishdate":"2019-01-15T00:12:05+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ifac/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we present the control of a robotic system for automation in manufacturing logistics based on the Open Platform for Innovations in Logistics (OPIL).
